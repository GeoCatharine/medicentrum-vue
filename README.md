Medicentrum in Vue

Free Figma design created with vue and scss, as part of training. All pictures and design idea belongs to Figma & their creator.
I divided content from previous exercise into multiple pages. Main goal of this exercise was full use of vue routing, creating responsive design & better understanding of scss mixins & functions.

Added:
-router
-carousel testimony box
-responsive design
-animated burger menu & footer menu
-data fetching for testimony box
-scss mixins, functions & variables
